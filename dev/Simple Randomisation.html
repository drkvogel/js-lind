<p>Random allocation of patients to treatment comparison groups is one of the 
  ways to ensure that tests of treatments are fair. Although random allocation can never
  ensure that treatment comparison groups are exactly comparable in all respects,
  it ensures that the composition of the comparison groups has not been biased by
  clinician or patient choices. Unless allocation bias is reduced in this way, any
  differences in the progress of patients in the comparison groups may simply
  reflect the fact that they were composed of patients who were different to begin
  with, and nothing to do with relative effects of different treatments.
</p><h4>Recorded, known patient characteristics</h4>
<p>Patients in the treatment comparison groups that have been generated using
  random allocation need to be sufficiently alike in characteristics (age, for
  example) which are known to influence their health problems. Reports of
  treatment comparisons, therefore, need to show that 'like patients' have been
  compared with 'other like patients'.
</p><h4>Unrecorded and, as yet, undiscovered patient characteristics</h4>
 <p>Patients in treatment comparison groups who differ in respect of unrecorded and
  as yet undiscovered characteristics of importance obviously cannot be shown to
  be comparable. However, because random allocation ensures that any
  unrecorded differences have been due to chance, these differences can be taken
  into account in statistical analyses, usually by calculating confidence intervals.</p>
<h4>Achieving balance in important patient characteristics</h4>
<p>The larger the number of patients allocated at random to treatment comparison
  groups, the more likely it is that the comparison groups will be made up of
  patients with comparable characteristics, and the less likely that large imbalances
  will remain. You can see this effect of increasing the numbers of patients using
  the random allocation program below. Ask the program to randomise successively
  larger numbers of patients (up to 100,000) and watch the way that the
  characteristics of the patients in the treatment comparison groups become
  increasingly balanced.</p>
